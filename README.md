# Hotel Management System

## Project Description
The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline hotel operations, enhance customer experience, and provide hotel staff with intuitive tools for management and analytics. This project is ideal for educational purposes, beginner Flask developers, or anyone interested in building web-based administrative systems with Python.

## Project Details

### Features
- **Room Management:** Add, edit, and track room availability, features, and pricing.
- **Customer Management:** Record and manage customer details, bookings, check-ins, and check-outs.
- **Dashboard with Analytics:** Real-time visualization of key metrics using charts and graphs.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Predicts customer satisfaction and provides insights using a trained model.
- **Admin Interface:** Secure admin functionality for backend operations.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Clean HTML and CSS templates for easy navigation.

### Machine Learning Integration
- Utilizes a supervised machine learning model trained on `hotel_dataset.csv` to predict customer satisfaction and analyze preferences.
- The model (`se_model.pkl`) is loaded in real-time within the Flask application.

### Admin and User Functionality
- **Admin:** Manage rooms, users, bookings, and view analytics via a secure dashboard.
- **User:** Register, log in, book rooms, view reservations, and manage bookings.

### Data and Model Files
- `hotel_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training the ML model.
- `se_model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model for satisfaction prediction.
